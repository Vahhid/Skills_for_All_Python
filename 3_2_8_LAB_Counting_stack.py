"""
Your task is to extend the Stack class behavior in such a way so that the class 
    is able to count all the elements that are pushed and popped (we assume that 
    counting pops is enough). Use the Stack class we've provided in the editor.

Follow the hints:

-introduce a property designed to count pop operations and name it in a way 
    which guarantees it is hidden;
-initialize it to zero inside the constructor;
-provide a method which returns the value currently assigned to the counter 
    (name it get_counter()).

Complete the code in the editor. Run it to check whether your code outputs 100.
